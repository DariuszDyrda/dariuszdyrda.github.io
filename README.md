Collection of simple JS projects


### 1. [Pong Game JS](https://dariuszdyrda.github.io/PongGameJS/index.html)
  Simple version of Pong created with HTML5 canvas. The main goal of the project was to implement the proper physics of bouncy ball.
  
### 2. [The RGB Guessing Game](https://dariuszdyrda.github.io/TheRGBGuessingGame/index.html)
  Guess the color based on the RGB code. Idea taken from Colt Steele's "The Web Developer Bootcamp". Own implementation though.
